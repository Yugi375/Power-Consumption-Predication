Loaded and analyzed power consumption dataset with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and diffuse flows; performed EDA including info() and head(). 
Developed and tuned regression models (XGBoost and Gradient Boosting) using Scikit-learn and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization on parameters like n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, and colsample_bytree.
Achieved MAE 687.07, RMSE 967.02, R² 0.979 with tuned XGBoost; MAE 815.80, RMSE 1153.72, R² 0.969 with tuned Gradient Boosting.
